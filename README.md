**What is this?**

Small app to calculate total wage when there are different wages based on when you are working.


**Function implemented:**
* One can add a working day in the form of date, start time and end time.
* One can retrieve all the past added working days and see how much one has earned of these days.
* One can filter by date and therefore check how much one has earned during this period of time.


**Does not work if used in a way it shouldn't be.**

**TODO:**
* Change from HashSet so the dates won't come in random order
